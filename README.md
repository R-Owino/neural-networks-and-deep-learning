## Neural Networks and Deep Learning Exercises

* Neural networks - a beautiful biologically inspired programming paradigm which enables a computer to learn from observational data
* Deep learning - powerful set of techniques for learning in neural networks 

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for the exercises from Michael Nielson's book ["Neural Networks and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html)

### Dependencies
These can be found in the [requirements.txt]() file, usage explained below.

### Usage
- Create a virtual environment in the project directory containing your work and change into that directory
- Run the following commands to create the virtual environment and activate it
```
python3 -m venv <name_of_venv>
source name_of_venv/bin/activate
```
- Install the dependencies in your venv from the requirments.txt file
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- In Chapter 1, to get a similar output as the one in the book, run `main.py` and for the excercise, run `main-1.py`
